Input files and scripts used to plot Figure S7, the averaged real and simulated within-meadow GDS over all sampling sites for Gullmarsfjord and Marstrand areas using Rozenfeld and Shared Allele Distance metrics.

Input files: 
- For the real GDS: sum of the frequency distribution (GDS) per meadow of all meadows in Marstrand and Gullmarsfjord using either Rozenfeld or Shared Allele Distance genetic distance metrics
		avg_GDS_Gullm_Rozenfeld.csv
		avg_GDS_Gullm_SAD.csv
		avg_GDS_Mars_Rozenfeld.csv
		avg_GDS_Mars_SAD.csv

- For the simulated GDS: freqeuncy distributions (GDS, in Histogram_densities/ folder) of each meadow when simulating probability of selfing 0.01, 0.1 and 0.3. Each folder only contains a few example histograms.
		pself = 0.01 -> /6.Repr_modes_together_survival&nosurvival_pself0.01
		pself = 0.1 -> /5.Repr_modes_together_survival&nosurvival_pself0.1
		pself = 0.3 -> /7.Repr_modes_together_survival&nosurvival_pself0.3
